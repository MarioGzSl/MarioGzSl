## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hey! I am a Software Engineer based in Seattle, and I am interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and programming contests. I love building web applications with React, and I constantly strive to improve my skills and knowledge in this field.

I have created several projects using NLP techniques, such as a chatbot, a text summarizer, and a sentiment analyzer. You can check them out on my GitHub profile.

I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and find them useful. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat.

Thanks for stopping by, have a great day!
